# Within Cell Differentiation (old)

This section focuses on the ability of sample entropy to distinguish between features generated from markov chains with the imrCons structure with different values of rho. We have 10 equally spaced values of rho and we sample `N` features, each of length `f` to create a template. We then sample from this template multiple times to simulate cell samples. Each feature has a starting distribution for the markov chain that is shared across samples.
