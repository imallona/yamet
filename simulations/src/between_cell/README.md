Between Cell Differentiation

This section focuses on the ability of shannon entropy to distinguish between features generated from markov chains with the imrRand structure with different values of rho (additive noise). We have 10 noise levels and we sample `N` features, each of length `f` to create a template. We then sample from this template multiple times to simulate cell samples. Each feature has a starting distribution for the markov chain that is shared across samples.
