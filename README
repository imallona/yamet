challenges

- which score to use?
- will we compare the agreement to the methylation to call DMRs and remove effect of fully meth, fully unmeth stuff? this is a triangular distribution anyway
- will we collapse stranded information before calling DMRs?
- why some positions have NA for both agreement and wt after running the metilene_input script?
